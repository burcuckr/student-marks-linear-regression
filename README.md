# 📊 Student Marks Prediction with Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied.

It is a simple Machine Learning project created to practice:
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test splitting
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization

## 🚀 Project Overview

The model learns the relationship between:

**Hours Studied → Marks Obtained**

Then it predicts marks for new study hours.
